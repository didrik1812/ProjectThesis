Papers from Stefanie:

Introductory literature - perhaps you get access to the book through NTNU, or the library has it:

What is a SNP? Some concepts explained:

Genomic prediction (pioneer paper, but maybe too advanced in terms of terminology etc)
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11290733/

The same authors later tried to explain things in more easy terms - maybe a good paper to start with actually:
https://academic.oup.com/af/article/6/1/6/4638797


ML for genomic prediction/selection (these are very recent articles, don't worry if you don't understand it all):
https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-07319-x
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2018.00237/full


Then an article that seems relevant for your master thesis:
